# HeatTransferSimulation-MPI
HEAT TRANSFER SIMULATION        Simple physical simulation of a rod connected at the left and right    ends to constant temperature heat/cold sources.  All positions on    the rod are set to an initial temperature.  Each time step, that    temperature is altered by computing the difference between a cells    temperature and its left and right neighbors.  A constant k    (thermal conductivity) adjusts these differences before altering    the heat at a cell.  Use the following model to compute the heat    for a position on the rod according to the finite difference    method.        left_diff  = H[t][p] - H[t][p-1];       right_diff = H[t][p] - H[t][p+1];       delta = -k*( left_diff + right_diff )       H[t+1][p] = H[t][p] + delta        Substituting the above, one can get the following       H[t+1][p] = H[t][p] + k*H[t][p-1] - 2*k*H[t][p] + k*H[t][p+1]     The matrix H is computed for all time steps and all positions on    the rod and displayed after running the simulation.  The simulation    is run for a fixed number of time steps rather than until    temperatures reach steady state.
